# RingPercentLabel
 Percent Labels for the Battery Widget Rings!

A simple tweak that adds a percent label inside the ring for the battery widget on iOS14. It's beneficial for the 2x2 widget only, so I wouldn't recommend using this tweak if you use 2x4 or 4x4 widget as those sizes already show the percentage!
